# fantasy-football-webscraper
 This application scrapes my fantasy footabll league (on Sleeper) and builds an optimal lineup out of free agents.
 
 This works around sleeper closing its API endpoints by scrapping with Selenium Chromedriver. It is a decent starting point for building any other automations on Sleepers site.
 
 Edit python script before using:
 1. Update path to where your chromedriver executable is saved.
 2. Update username and password to sleeper in a not included secrets.py file (keep in same directory as main).
